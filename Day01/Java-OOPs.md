# Day 1 – OOPs Concepts in Java

## ✔ Introduction
OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming System) is a programming model used in Java to structure programs into simple, reusable pieces of code called **objects**.

OOP helps in:
- Reusability  
- Clean structure  
- Easy maintenance  
- Better design  

---

## ✔ 1️⃣ Class
A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.

Example: Car blueprint → creates multiple cars.

---

## ✔ 2️⃣ Object
Object is an instance of a class.  
When you create an object, memory is allocated.

---

## ✔ 3️⃣ Inheritance
Inheritance allows one class to use the properties of another class.

Example:  
Dog inherits from Animal.

Benefits:
- Code reuse  
- Easy extension  

---

## ✔ 4️⃣ Polymorphism
Polymorphism means "many forms".  
Same method behaves differently in different classes.

Example:  
`sound()` in Animal vs Dog.

---

## ✔ 5️⃣ Encapsulation
Binding data + methods together using:
- private variables  
- getters & setters  

Encapsulation protects data.

---

## ✔ 6️⃣ Abstraction
Showing **only essential details** and hiding unnecessary data.

Achieved using:
- Abstract classes  
- Interfaces  

---

## ✔ Key Takeaway
OOPs is the foundation of:
- Java
- Spring Boot
- Backend development

Understanding OOPs makes building REST APIs and backend systems much easier.
